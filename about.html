					<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>o put it quite simply, I <span class="bolded">live</span> co-ops and natural foods stores! I've had a passion for cooperation and local, sustainable economy that dates back as far as I can remember.</p>

					<p>When it came time to decide what my grown up job would be I decided I would take my talents as an artist and designer to the professional level - interior design and architecture. I added a marketing degree later on because I feel stores need to find their voice in the new age of direct competition and I want to help them.</p>

					<p>I graduated undergrad and started working at United Natural Foods as a Store Planner and after 7 years of designing independent natural food stores and co-ops, I started consulting with CDS Consulting Co-oop. I've been a consultant since 2012 and can't imagine doing anything else.</p>

					<p>One of the best parts of working at UNFI for so long was the great independent stores I got to work with. I built great relationships and still work with many independent natural foods stores today. They rock!</p>

					<p>I put 110% into every project and those stores become like second homes to me. And through a proven expertise in visual arts, I can help those stores lead the way of the future. </p>
